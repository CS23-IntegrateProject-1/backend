# Integrated Project Backend

## File Structure

- `prisma/`: Prisma configuration and database schema.
- `src/`: Project source code.
  - `config/`: Configuration files and utilities.
    - `corsConfig.ts`: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration.
    - `dotenvConfig.ts`: Environment variable configuration.
  - `controllers/`: Application controllers responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses.
  - `routes/`: Route definitions for mapping HTTP endpoints to controller actions.
  - `services/`: Service logic, which includes business logic, data processing, and storing data from other sources (e.g., APIs).
  - `middlewares/`: Custom middleware functions used in request processing (e.g., authentication, validation).
- `index.ts`: Entry point for the application.
- `.env`: Environment variables and configuration.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration.

## Explanation

- **prisma/**: This directory contains Prisma configuration files and database schema definitions. 

- **src/**: This is the main directory for your project's source code.
  - **config/**: Configuration files and utilities related to the project's settings and setup.
    - **corsConfig.ts**: Configuration for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which determines which origins are allowed to access your API.
    - **dotenvConfig.ts**: Configuration for environment variables, allowing you to manage various settings and secrets used in your application.
  - **controllers/**: Controllers handle incoming HTTP requests and define how the application responds to them. They often interact with services to process data.
  - **routes/**: Route definitions map specific HTTP endpoints to controller actions. They define the API's structure and the URL paths that clients can access.
  - **services/**: Services contain the business logic of your application. They may interact with databases, external APIs, or perform other tasks related to data processing. In your case, services also store data from other sources, which could include data retrieved from external APIs.
  - **middlewares/**: Middlewares are functions that intercept and process HTTP requests before they reach the route handlers. They are used for tasks like authentication, validation, and error handling.

- **index.ts**: This file serves as the entry point for your application. It typically sets up the Express server, connects to the database (if applicable), and defines how the server should listen for incoming requests.

- **.env**: Environment variables and configuration settings are often stored in this file. It allows you to keep sensitive information and configuration separate from your code.

- **package.json**: This file contains information about your project's dependencies and scripts. You can use it to manage and install the necessary packages for your project.

- **tsconfig.json**: The TypeScript configuration file that specifies how TypeScript should transpile your code. It ensures type checking and compiles your TypeScript code into JavaScript.

## Git Branches

When working with Git, it's essential to use branches to manage your project's codebase effectively. Branches allow you to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Here's how to create and work with branches in your Git repository:
